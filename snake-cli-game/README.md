# Rust Snake Game

A terminal-based port of my Arduino Snake game.

This project is a Rust implementation of my own made for fun Snake game, which I originally created for Arduino in C some years ago.

Recommended to use very old [IBM BIOS font](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/font?ibm_bios) for authentic square-pixel graphics.
